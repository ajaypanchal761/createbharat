3. Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd) – Best for growth and funding. Has limited liability and can issue shares. Example: Ola, Zomato, Flipkart.
4. LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) – A mix of partnership and company. Partners have limited liability. Example: Consultancy firms, early-stage startups.

Key Differences:

3. Take feedback – Explain your idea to 10–20 people and collect feedback.
